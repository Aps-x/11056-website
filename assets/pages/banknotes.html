                    The note features Queen Elizabeth II wearing Garter robes on the obverse with the 
                    Australian coat of arms. This portrait was based on a photo taken by Douglas Glass.

                    The reverse of the note features Aboriginal contemporary art, created by David 
                    Malangi. The artwork depicts the "mortuary feast" of one of the artist's creation 
                    ancestors, Gunmirringu, the great ancestral hunter.

                    The two dollar note was replaced by a gold-coloured coin on 14 June 1988, 
                    due to the longer service life and cost effectiveness of coins. These notes can 
                    still be redeemed at face value by the Reserve Bank of Australia and most commercial 
                    banks, but numismatics and note collectors may pay a higher price for these notes 
                    depending on age and condition.
