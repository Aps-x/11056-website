                Gordon Andrews:
                <span class="txt-clr-red">A Designer's Life</span>
            </h1>

            <h2 class="about__heading">Early Life</h2>
            <p>
                As a young man in Sydneyâ€™s inner west Gordon Andrews showed an early aptitude for 
                drawing and carpentry. His school days were not happy ones, as conventional schooling 
                did little to support his creativity, but upon leaving school Andrews studied 
                engineering, art and design at the East Sydney Technical College where his skills were 
                nurtured and he flourished. His father, a stonemason who later studied mechanical 
                engineering, was himself an inventor and designer. Andrews often acknowledged the debt 
                he owed to his father for not only giving him the genetic ability to design, but for 
                inspiring him to follow in his footsteps. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="about__heading">Career</h2>
            <p>
                Andrews' first role was as a junior commercial artist with an advertising agency in 
                Sydney.  The experience, confidence and credibility he gained soon allowed him to 
                undertake other roles, including many overseas commissions. Andrews worked in 
                advertising in London for several years before eventually returning to Australia in 
                1939. From 1949 through to the mid-1950s, he undertook commissions in the United Kingdom 
                and Italy, where he found he was able to combine two of his passions; travel and design.  
            </p>
            <p>
                In the early 1960s, having returned to Australia, Andrews worked on a number of high 
                profile projects for the Australian Government. His design work included the interiors 
                of the Australian Pavilion of the Comptoire Suisse trade fair (and other expositions in 
                Paris, Tokyo and Cologne), the New South Wales Government Tourist Bureau in Sydney, and 
                the New Zealand Government Tourist Bureau. Later commissions included designing the logo
                for the Reserve Bank of Australia, design work on the National Gallery, Parliament 
                House and National Athletics Stadium buildings in Canberra, and various sculptures, 
                fountains and civic projects in the ACT and NSW. At a time when Australian design was 
                seen as parochial in outlook and execution, Andrews stood out as a designer of 
                international style and sophistication.

            <h2 class="about__heading">Designing the first decimal banknotes</h2>
            <p>
                In 1963 Andrews was invited to submit designs for Australia's new decimal currency 
                banknotes, along with fellow designers Richard Beck, Max Forbes and George Hamori. 
                The selection committee, headed by Russell Drysdale, voted unanimously for Andrews' 
                designs, and on 14 February, 1966, Australia's new decimal $1, $2, $10 and $20 banknotes 
                entered circulation. His designs were bold and each banknote captured a unique aspect of
                Australian life. Andrews was subsequently engaged to design the $5 banknote, issued in 
                1967, and later the $50 banknote, issued in 1973. When polymer notes began to replace 
                paper ones, Andrews served on the advisory panel that oversaw their design. Shortly 
                after Andrews' death in 2001 his friend Alan James noted, 'I know of no other currency 
                that captures the rugged vibrancy and spirit of a place the way ours does. To his 
                continuing credit, the new polymer notes reflect the spirit of the work he did'.

            <h2 class="about__heading">Gordon Andrews: A cultural hero</h2>
            <p>
                As a designer, Gordon Andrews' work ranged from the functional to the more conceptual. 
                His international career included industrial design, furniture, jewellery, interiors, 
                graphics, murals, exhibitions and photography. In 1955 his reputation as one of 
                Australia's leading industrial designers and a designer of international standing was 
                cemented when he became the first Australian designer to be elected a Fellow of the UK 
                Society of Industrial Artists and Designers. Other honours followed, including 
                membership of the Faculty of Royal Designers for Industry, and the Alliance Graphique 
                Internationale. In 1985 he was awarded the gold medal by the Design Institute of 
                Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gordon Andrews died in Sydney on 17 January 2001. He is regarded by many as one of the few 
                renaissance men of the art world, being a designer, sculptor, painter, carpenter, photographer,
                cartoonist, silversmith and illustrator. He is widely acknowledged as one of Australia's most 
                prominent mid-20th century multi-disciplinary artists.
